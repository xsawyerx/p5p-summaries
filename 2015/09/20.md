## Bug reports and bug fixes

### Fuzzing to find bugs

More tickets were opened by Dan Collins and Brian Carpenter, results of fuzzing
perl and uncovering interesting ways to crash perl.

Brian Carpenter found two bugs causing a null pointer dereference, leading
to a segfault ([Perl #126191](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126191),
[Perl #126192](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126192)).

Brian Carpenter found a couple of assertion failures
([Perl #126193](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126193),
[Perl #126170](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126170)).

Dan Collins found a double free problem
([Perl #126199](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126199)).
Vincent Pit was able to provide a summary of this bug in the form of:

    $[ .= *[ = 'y'

which I found too cool to leave out.

Dan Collins provided a segfault
([Perl #126204](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126204))
caused by the following reduced regex:

    /(?[()-!])/

[Perl #126206](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126206) is
a floating point exception. Reported by Dan Collins.

[Perl #126042](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126042) is
a stack corruption caused by perl losing track of the stack pointer.
Reported by Dan Collins, fixed by Father Chrysostomos.

[Perl #126064](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126064):
Yet another stack corruption; like the previous one,
reported by Dan Collins, fixed by Father Chrysostomos.

Father C. raised a problem with the implementation details of `PL_sv_yes`,
and cautiously proposed removing it from perl space. Zefram supported and
added that -- even if implemented correctly -- it would still be wrong.

[Perl #126188](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126188):
When requiring [IO::File](https://metacpan.org/pod/IO::File) in an attempt
to resolve missing method on a hash, a segfault happens. Yet more results
of fuzzing. Reported by Dan Collins.

Ricardo Signes bumped another fuzzing bug which caused a segfault and Shlomi
Fish provided a patch, seconded by Reini Urban and discussed and approved
on #p5p - leading to the patch being applied.
([Perl #125350](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=125350))

### Portability fixes

Dan Collins provided a patch for compiling perl on GNU/Linux which
was bisected to one of the recent AmigaOS-related changes.
([Perl #126152](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126152))

Dan Collins reports a problem with building quadmath Perl. Bulk88
provided more comments and Lukas Mai delved into `util.c` finding a
potential memory leak with the quadmath-related code.
([Perl #126203](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126203))

Sisyphus raised an issue of a test that has been failing for him on
Windows 7 since perl 5.23.3 having to do with read-only file attributes.
With the help of Tony Cook the packaging problem was solved.
([Perl #126133](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126133))

Bulk88 provided additional information to a ticket requested to revert
a patch that caused a problem on Visual C. Karl Williamson does not wish
to revert it and instead offers to handle the specific compiler
explicitly.
([Perl #126045](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126045))

### `sv_backoff` optimisation

Bulk88 provided a patch for making `sv_backoff` more tailcall friendly
([Perl #126171](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126171)).

`sv_backoff` would change its return value from **int** to **void**, but
as Bulk88 explains, since it was previously only returning a meaningless
constant value and since it should be reached via the public API function
`sv_setsv(sv, &PL_sv_undef)` (or several others) anyway, it shouldn't be
a problem. He also added this explanation as a documentation patch.

### `File::Find` portability issue

Robert Mah raised a problem with
[File::Find](https://metacpan.org/pod/File::Find) working between CIFS
and GNU/Linux systems - one supports *nlink* while the other does not
and `File::Find` failed to understand this. Dave Mitchell showed the
commit that tries to identify it, and additional research by Robert has
shown other C utilities seem to have this problem too.
([Perl #126144](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126144))

### More optimisations

Bulk88 bumped a ticket he opened at the beginning of 2014 to optimize two
functions using tied hashes. The bump resulted in additional comments from
Tony Cook, following several rounds of comments and fixes between Dave
Mitchell and Bulk88.
([Perl #121348](https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=121348))

He also provided a patch for optimizing some stack manipulation.
([Perl #126196](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126196))

### Mysterious `mod_perl` compilation crash

Additional information provided by Michael Schout on a crash involving
pre-compiling modules under `mod_perl` tracing back to commit which fixed
a seemingly unrelated bug.
([Perl #126145](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126145))

### Documenting the names of types

Linda Walsh opened a ticket regarding additional reference type
documentation. Ricardo adds an explanation of `Regexp` vs. `REGEXP`
and notes additional types that should probably be documented along the
way. ([Perl #126150](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126150))

### Finding modules on case-insensitive filesystems

Patrick Zimmermann raised an issue with loading modules on case-insensitive
systems. Zefram provided an explanation on why this happens, unfortunately
a combination of correct behavior with an API design of an optional
`import` method in a module - something that cannot be changed.
([Perl #126167](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126167))

### Crashing perl with `x`

Dan Collins raised a problem with the `x` operator causing a segfault
when operating on a list. The ticket contains an in-depth discussion
on the problem and possible fixes.
([Perl #125937](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=125937))

### What's in th `%!` hash

Felipe Gasper opened a ticket suggesting to document the ability to
use the values of `%!`.
([Perl #125350](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126174))

### Several regexp bugs

Victor ADAM has raised a ticket that the regexp pattern `]]]]][\\`
should raise an error but does not. Karl Williamson was able to
reproduce, write a patch, and will seek additional cases before pushing
it. ([Perl #126141](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126141))

He opened several other regex-related tickets:

* [Perl #126179](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126179):
  Regression with `\N{}`.
* [Perl #126181](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126181):
  `\c` inside `(?[])`.
* [Perl #126182](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126182):
  `/(.(?2))((?<=(?=(?1)).))/` hangs, eats all available RAM.
* [Perl #126185](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126185):
  `/(?-p)/` should raise an error.
* [Perl #126186](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126186):
  Document `(*COMMIT:arg)` and `(*ACCEPT:arg)`.
* [Perl #126177](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126177):
  `(?n)` should be documented.
* [Perl #126187](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126187):
  `/\p /` and `/\p^/` give strange warnings.
* [Perl #126180](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126180):
  `/(?[\ &!])/` segfaults.
* [Perl #126178](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126178):
  `/(?i/` and similar should raise an error.

## Discussions

### Smart Match, again

Ricardo Signes has laid out plans on cleaning up Smart Match and has
provided [test cases](https://gist.github.com/rjbs/fb5716d7dbd4f23939ea)
for the new expected behavior of Smart Match.

It would seem like Smart Match is going to get very clear, simple, and
most importantly, expected syntax.

The [thread itself](http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2015/09/msg230881.html)
is quite long and I recommend reading it only if you're interested in
what people had snagged on. The aforementioned gist provides a clear
spec of what Smart Match would become. The discussion thread also
contains some comments by Zefram on what he believes is also confusion
in Smart Match in
[Perl 6](http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2015/09/msg231292.html).

### Revising version string semantics

Following Lyon QA Hackathon and
[its decisions](https://gist.github.com/dagolden/9559280), Ricardo Signes
provided
[a summary](http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2015/09/msg231216.html)
and queried for any reasoned objections to moving
forward with the recommendations. Questions were asked for clarifying
specific situations and amending was done on the linked gist.

### Spaces in `qr/\p L/`

Karl Williamson
[asked for comments](http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2015/09/msg231263.html)
on having spaces when using `\p` (the
syntax for named Unicode properties) in regular expressions:

    qr/\p L/

vs.

    qr/\p L/x

Agreement that both should fail from Ricardo Signes, Yitzchak
Scott-Thoennes, and Abigail.

### Removing legacy code from `B`

Nicolas R. [suggested](http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2015/09/msg230985.html)
removing "dead code" from core (specifically
[B](https://metacpan.org/pod/B) relating to some `PERL_VERSION` checks and
provided a patch removing it. This turned into a conversation on what
"dead code" is and whether it should be removed.

Main positions:

* Dave Mitchell agrees with removing the code.
* Tony Cook applied the patch.
* Reini Urban disagrees, as it was used as boilerplate code on CPAN.
* Todd Rinaldo supports removal and suggests considering adding docs.

Continued discussion:

Rocco Caputo asked about guidelines on obsolete implementations and dead code
in general while Aristotle Pagaltzis asked to think of this change in the
context of the recently-surfaced concept of the
[CPAN river](http://neilb.org/tag/cpan-river/) and doubts whether the code
in question is, in fact, dead code.

Ricardo Signes proposed a practical solution along Todd's suggestion, opting
for finding a proper place for any important information which might be lost
in this commit - documentation.

Bulk88 had offered an example with [Encode](https://metacpan.org/pod/Encode)
supporting older perl versions with what could be described as "dead code",
which Ricardo explained as a incorrect example, since `Encode` can be installed
on older perl versions, while new versions of [B](https://metacpan.org/pod/B)
cannot.

### Unshifting `undef` to `@ISA`

Vadim Pushtaev opened
[a ticket](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126082) about
unshifting more than one value to `@ISA`, leading to a
[discussion](http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2015/09/msg231063.html)
about the problem.

Zefram was able to distill that example further. Aristotle Pagaltzis
suggests this raises two bugs instead of one: A loop that occurring
pushing `undef` to `@ISA`, and unshifting multiple defined
values causing perl to unshift `undef`. Eirik Berg Hanssen was able
to suggest a third bug which occurs inside an `eval` showing a different
behavior.

Paul "LeoNerd" Evans suggested a possible reason for the warnings which
both Vadim and Zefram agree is the real cause. The problem? In Paul's
own words:

> Random guess: 'unshift' has to create multiple holes at the start of
> the array so it doesn't suffer O(n^2) behaviour.

Zefram expands:

> Pretty much.  pp_unshift() internally performs an av_unshift() followed
> by a bunch of av_store()s.  av_unshift() doesn't take parameters for the
> values to unshift; it always sticks undefs in.  (Actually null pointers
> internally.)  The av_store() calls invoke magic on the array.

Dagfinn Ilmari Mannsåker reminds there is a separate bug unearthed during
the debugging process in which storing `undef` values in `@main::ISA` warns
101 times before dying when detecting inheritance recursion. Paul's observation
should be noted:

> Oops; sounds like the code to detect and warn against the chance of
> an infinite recursion bug itself suffers an infinite recursion bug.

Ilmari provided a patch to delay the `@ISA` set magic until all items are
assigned (which is what is done in `push` but not `unshift`).

Tony Cook explained why the original magic delay code for `push` (and
thus the proposed same solution for `unshift`) is actually wrong and
offered a different solution instead.

Ilmari offered a new patch fixing both according to Tony's suggestion.

### Optimizing reference checks

At the beginning of the month Jarkko Hietaniemi
[raised](http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2015/09/msg230637.html)
a personal annoyance with the fact that:

    ref $foo eq 'ARRAY'

actually gets compiled into a string `eq` against the string constant
`ARRAY`, which makes it not just inefficient, but also a possible problem
with blessed references - whether arrayref or `ARRAY` package name, not
to mention typo possibilities.

Zefram suggested a similar solution to what
[Params::Classify](https://metacpan.org/pod/Params::Classify) does. Kent
noted that it's Perl should have a native `typeof` kind of check.

Bulk88 further delved into implementation details of other languages in
this respect and what possible changes could happen in perl 5 in order to
accommodate this (and beyond). Unfortunately his email did not receive
comments.

### Dereferencing and "anonymous scalars"

Bob Kleemann hit
[a snag](http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2015/09/msg231048.html)
when trying to dereference a variable referencing
a previous variable with the same name using version numbers.

    my $v = shift;
    $v = \$v;
    say sprintf("v%vd", $$v); # prints address, not value

Tony Cook explains it succinctly:

> You're setting $v to a reference to itself, so $$v is the value of $v,
> which is a reference [...].

Bob found a solution as the following code:

    $v = \eval { $v };

This introduced an interesting thread on what Eirik Berg Hanssen referred
to as *anonymous scalars*.

By the way, following an exhaustive explanation by Aristotle Pagaltzis, Bob
eventually went with:

    $v = \do { my $copy = $v };

### `AUTOLOAD` on non-existing tied hash methods

Bulk88 [asks](http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2015/09/msg231207.html)
whether `AUTOLOAD` should be called when some methods of a tied
hash do not exist.

Chas. Owen shared code demonstrating that the only function that must be
handled is `TIEHASH`.

### Possible optimization for tied hashes

Bulk88 [wondered](http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2015/09/msg231210.html)
about possibly calling `scalar keys` on a tied hash instead
of iterating over the keys and values, which would result in a nice
optimization. Tony Cook explained why it will not be suitable for the
purpose.

### `stat` with an array

Following [a ticket](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126162)
raised by Jozef Mojzis, Dan Collins
[writes](http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2015/09/msg231304.html)
that a side effect of fixing at
least two crash-inducing bugs, `stat` no longer works on arrays. He suggests
declaring it a *WONTFIX* or add a warning and a note in
[perldelta](https://metacpan.org/pod/perldelta).

Father Chrysostomos [adds](http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2015/09/msg231309.html)
a reasonable use-case for `stat(@_)` and suggests
researching additional usages before attempting to fix it, one way or the
other, and Eirik Berg Hanssen offers reasons to both document in perldelta
and raise a warning.

Dan Collins provided a patch to warn with a documentation change.

### Stack overflow with `XS_RETURN`?

Following [a ticket](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=125937)
(mentioned above) referring to the `x` operator causing a segfault, Bulk88
[wondered](http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2015/09/msg231329.html)
whether the `XS_RETURN` family of macros could introduce a segfault
as well. Dave Mitchell explained how it would not be possible, but added
that maybe we should make it explicit in the documentation and by adding
assertions.

### Negative values in `XSRETURN`

Doug Bell [asked](http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2015/06/msg228284.html)
what should happen when `XSRETURN` receives a negative
value as a parameter. Dave Mitchell, backed by H. Merijn Brand (Tux),
suggests that since this corrupts the stack, an assertion should be added.

A patch provided and being smoked.

### Branch cleanups

Dave Mitchell sent another email with
[a list](http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2015/09/msg231254.html)
of temporary Git branches
to be deleted, asking people to prune them.
