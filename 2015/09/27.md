# September 27th - October 4th

## Bug reports and bug fixes

[Storable](https://metacpan.org/pod/Storable)'s tests don't seem to be
able to run in parallel, as
[Perl #126213](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126213) points
out.

James E. Keenan suggests moving forward on the patch by Tony Cook
to address [Perl #126084](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126084)
fixing the `do undef` problem Ricardo Signes raised.

Konstantin Kokin reported in
[Perl #126224](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126224) apparent
slowness in [IO::Socket::INET](https://metacpan.org/pod/IO::Socket::INET)
when testing with [ab](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/programs/ab.html).
Paul "LeoNerd" Evans suggested it might have to do with DNS queries (which
Konstantin rejected) and ventured that
[IO::Socket::IP](https://metacpan.org/pod/IO::Socket::IP) might do better.
Mark Overmeer mentioned that playing with `ab` parameters, especially `-c`,
provided a positive change, meaning it might have to do with `ab` itself.
He also suggested DNS indeed could be related.

Zhenyi Zhou opened
[Perl #126229](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126229),
explaining that [POSIX](https://metacpan.org/pod/POSIX)'s `strerror` clears
the value of `$!`. It was reduced further by Zhenyi and Dave Mitchell to:

    $! = 29;
    { local $! = $! }
    print "[$!]\n"; # prints "[]"

In Dave's words:

> Its a messy interaction between local() and magic vars.
> I'm not sure it can be fixed.

Ed Avid raised
[Perl #126239](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126239),
addressing [File::Glob](https://metacpan.org/pod/File::Glob)'s confusing
documentation regarding the `GLOB_NOCHECK` option.

Bulk88 provided a patch in
[Perl #126242](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126242) to fix
a compilation error when using `NO_HASH_SEED` in combiation with the
default hash algorithm (`PERL_HASH_FUNC_ONE_AT_A_TIME_HARD`), existing
since 5.17.10.

Todd Rinaldo provided a patch in
[Perl #126244](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126244) to
remove `B::Section`, as Todd describes:

> This package is a vestigial reminant of
> [B::C](https://metacpan.org/pod/B::C)'s removal [...]

### Regex bugs

Victor Adam is continuing his quest for finding weird Regexp bugs and
raised [Perl #126222](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126222),
finding a problem with:

    print /(?(?!)(?{print "Yes"})|(?{print "No"}))/

Victor also raised
[Perl #126253](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126253),
expecting perl to die when seeing the two following regexp patterns:

    /.{1}??/
    /.{1}?+/

And following up on one of his ticket, Victor, he also whipped up a
patch to fix
[Perl #126181](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126181)
(a bug he opened the week prior), handling `\c` inside `(?[])`.

## Discussions

### Supporting `qr/\p^L/`

Following the conversation on `\p` with a space, Karl Williamson
[asked for comments](...)
regarding `\p` (the syntax for named Unicode properties) with a following
carret (`^`) symbol. One suggestion is not supporting it, the other is
making it the same `\P`. This would mean that:

    qr/\p^L/

would be the equivalent of:

    qr/\PL/

* Aristotle Pagaltzis asked why have one support the other.
* Abigail supported throwing an error.
* Ricardo Signes agreed.
* Eric Brine provided a few points in favor and many against, summarizing
  he also doesn't like it.

### Remove unused `define`s in `perl.h`

Karl Williamson also raised
[Perl #231533](http://nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/231533) a few
`define` statements in `perl.h` which he suggests to remove. According to
Karl, they currently aren't in used in Perl core, in CPAN, probably by
anyone else, and they are wrong on EBCDIC platforms.

### `$SIG{__WARN__}` and `PL_warnhook` can have different values

Max Maischein opened
[Perl #125439](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=125439)
discussing the ability of `$SIG{__WARN__}` and `PL_warnhook` to have
different values, which he thinks is similiar to the (patched by him)
behavior of `$$`.

> For example, `PerlIO_find_layer` assigns directly to `PL_warnhook`
> without updating `$SIG{__WARN__}`, and buggy XS modules could
> do the same.

Max suggests picking up [Coro](https://metacpan.org/pod/Coro)'s
implementation which always write+read `PL_warnhook`, analogous to
`$SIG{__DIE__}`.

If this was indeed embraced, Coro could eliminate its workaround
for patching the magic vtable entries.

Dave Mitchell supports the proposition.

Max is now working on a patch.

### WinCE smokes and the problem with CPAN smokers

Ricardo Signes was wondering on the ability to receive semi-regular
smoke reports of WinCE.

Bulk88 noted the different considerations in WinCE which make it difficult
to test: WinCE Perl cannot redirect stdio easily, PP system() not available,
the console window itself is drawn by perl using a 3rd party library(!),
no shell process.

Bulk88 also suggested a way to allow testing on WinCE by transporting the
reports to a different machine that will process them.

Aristotle Pagaltzis explained that it is possible that the standardization
of CPAN smoke testers, which made it very simple to set up smokers,
actually works against our favor since they are created in a similar way,
thus lending to the "monoculture" situation of smoker set ups being too
common and not varied enough.

### The `%!` hash

Following last week, Felipe Gasper stressed the point that, if we don't
document how `%!` should be used people might use it in a way that works
but isn't intended, and which might change.

How to use it:

    if ( $!{'NOENT'} ) { ... }

How not to use it:

    if ( $! == $!{'ENOENT'} ) { ... }

Ricardo Signes introduced
[3b90fd9](http://perl5.git.perl.org/perl.git/commitdiff/3b90fd9) to
address this.

### Turning compile-time warnings off for good

Sam Kington raised a problem they're having at work while upgrading to
a perl 5.20.3. Using smartmatch extensively, warnings are beginning to
mount up. Using `no warnings 'experimental::smartmatch'` handles the
warnings until they load any module that introduces all warnings again,
such as [Moose](https://metacpan.org/pod/Moose) or
[Dancer](https://metacpan.org/pod/Dancer/) (or
[Dancer2](https://metacpan.org/pod/Dancer2)).

Unfortunately perl has no way to prevent a different module from importing
warnings into your namespace after you've adjusted them to your
satisfaction.

Several offers were made, but at the end of the day, Zefram concluded that
the only way to handle this properly would be in the modules themselves.

Sawyer X (me) introduced a change into Dancer 2, which David Precious will
adapt to the feature-frozen Dancer 1, to allow importing Dancer without
the additional pragmas it provides:

    use strict;
    use warnings;
    no warnings 'experimental::smartmatch';
    use Dancer2 ':nopragmas'; # does not reimport

### perl's AUTHORS file

In an earlier thread (stemming from
[Perl #126057](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126057), a
problem with the `pending-author.t` test), Dave Mitchell wondered whether
we should still be maintaining an AUTHORS file instead of simply using
Git's history.

There were objections from James E. Keenan and Abigail, expressing that
maintaining the file has little overhead and both helps a way to honor
contributors and is needed in case contributors do not have a perl git
repository available for their contribution. It was decided to keep it
then.

### Process of using undocumented globals

Karl Williamson provided a
[patch](http://perl5.git.perl.org/perl.git/commitdiff/5a4fed095144d9c2f728401b3a0938f80aca4bcc)
to clarify the process of using undocumented globals. In short:

> One should send email to p5p first to get the go-ahead for documenting
> and using an undocumented function or global variable. 

## News

## Grant report and major speed-up

Dave Mitchell provides his #98 and #99
[grant report](http://nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/231501).

The highlights include working on making `EXTEND` and `MEXTEND` (macros
for growing the stack) more robust against count truncating and wrapping
(derived from
[Perl #125937](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=125937),
mentioned in last week's summary) and optimizing the Boyer-Moore string
finder (used in regexps and `index`).

The latter is an important speed improvement, as explained by Dave:

> On my glibc linux x86\_64 systems, this code is now 7 times faster:

    $s = "a" x 1000 . "wxyz";
    $s =~ /wxyz/ for 1..30000;

The [commit](http://perl5.git.perl.org/perl.git/commitdiff/2119163cf9aaa352780f851b9f0b14473ec55a41)
includes the fascinating details.

Follwing this work, Aristotle Pagaltzis revealed `index` to still be
faster, opting Yves Orton to suggest there's further optimization to be
achieved on this.

### Lexical topic removed!

Father Chrysostomos provided a branch to remove the lexical topic variable
`my $_`. It was rebased and merged by Ricardo Signes with the help of
Dagfinn Ilmari Manns√•ker.

If you have any code that runs `my $_`, please update it, since the
feature will officially be removed in perl 5.24.
