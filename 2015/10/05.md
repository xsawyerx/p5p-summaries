# October 5th-11th

Karl Williamson continues his work on
[Unicode::Normalize](https://metacpan.org/pod/Unicode::Normalize) and with
the help of reports from Yaroslav Kuzmin was able to speed up the normalizer.

## Bug reports and bug fixes

Thomas Sibley [verified](http://nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/231588)
the possible problem with
[IO::Socket::INET](https://metacpan.org/pod/IO::Socket::INET) was indeed
a DNS lookup issue:

> Indeed, every call to `$c->get_request()` calls `$d->url`, which calls
> `gethostbyaddr()` in the case of your usage of LocalAddr:

James E. Keenan is on a ticket cleaning spree. He had so far taken up
[Perl #65052](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=65052),
[Perl #116254](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=116254),
[Perl #117341](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=117341),
[Perl #117963](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=117963),
[Perl #120330](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=120330),
[Perl #121553](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=121553),
and [Perl #120841](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=120841).

Vincent Pit opened
[Perl #126240](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126240) the week
prior (which last week's summary missed - sorry) on `fork()` causing a
panic at destruction time with a debugging threaded blead perl on Mac OS X
Yosemite.

Bulk88 submitted a patch in
[Perl #126273](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126273) to help
debug work with the *Save Stack*, and Dave Mitchell
[provided](http://nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/231590)
several hints he finds less invasive. Interesting for anyone else seeking
to debug the save stack.

Dave Mitchell had
[traced](http://nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/231596) the cause
of [Perl #126145](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126145) (a
`mod_perl` pre-compiling modules crash) back to a outdated module,
[Sub::Attribute](https://metacpan.org/pod/Sub::Attribute).

Dagfinn Ilmari MannsÃ¥ker provided a patch in
[Perl #126281](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126281) to
improve error messages by including the name of non-lvalue subroutines.

[Perl #31923](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=31923), a segfault
which can be triggered by `use encoding 'utf8'`, had been fixed.

Lukas Mai opened
[Perl #125305](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126305) about
constant folding barewords with unary minus.

Several errno tests currently fail, reported in
[Perl #126306](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126306) by
Jarkko Hietaniemi, relating to a smiliar problem in IRIX, reported by
Jarkko in [Perl #123977](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123977).

Perl does not warn about malformed UTF-8 characters if a string is
enclosed in single quotes, now reflected in
[Perl #126310](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126310).

### Regex bugs

Victor Adam is
[continuing](http://nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/231508)
to persue regular expression test writing. He's
been working on several bugs he had reported:
[Perl #126141](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126141),
[Perl #126177](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126177),
[Perl #126178](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126178),
[Perl #126179](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126179),
[Perl #126180](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126180),
[Perl #126181](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126181),
[Perl #126185](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126185),
[Perl #126186](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126186) (which
is now fixed and resolved by Yves Orton in
[fee505829585692618c3f9bb28a8f0464553ec94](http://perl5.git.perl.org/perl.git/commitdiff/fee505829585692618c3f9bb28a8f0464553ec94),
[Perl #126187](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126187),
[Perl #126222](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126222), and
[Perl #126253](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126253).

### Fuzzing to find bugs

Dan Collins opened
[Perl #126274](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126274), a crash
caused by the following interesting set of characters:

    ($0[(((0/[(())])[()]))])

Dan also opened
[Perl #126309](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126309), a
segfault caused by:

    @0[(0)x~0]

Dan found even `pack` can crash with the following code, opened under
[Perl #126325](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126325):

    pack+WH200000,\0

Dan also opened
[Perl #126319](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126319)
which causes a crash with this interesting piece of regex:

    /\b{sb}\b{wb}//b{}//>s>>>g>>0

## Discussions

### `cadvise` static code checker

Jarkko Hietaniemi
[ran](http://nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/231612) a static code checker called
[cadvise](http://h21007.www2.hp.com/portal/site/dspp/menuitem.863c3e4cbcdc3f3515b49c108973a801/?ciid=8b08a31f05f02110a31f05f02110275d6e10RCRD) and
the report might contains some very interesting bits.

### `File::Glob` shelling out?

Karl Williamson opened
[Perl #126271](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126271) which
exposes a possibly unsafe (and possibly unnecessary) shelling out in
[File::Glob](https://metacpan.org/pod/File::Glob). The
[conversation thread](http://nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/231569)
exposes more reasons for it and possible solutions.

### Continuing redesign of Math-BigInt

Peter John Acklam
[reopened the discussion](http://nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/231625)
on his redesign of the distribution carrying
[Math::BigInt](https://metacpan.org/pod/Math::BigInt),
[Math::BigRat](https://metacpan.org/pod/Math::BigRat),
and [bignum](https://metacpan.org/pod/bignum) mentioning the distributions
supporting both procedural function calls being supported at the same time
as object-oriented style.

Bulk88 had the following quote-worthy sentence in his reply:

> dont[sic] use OOP or convert functional code to OOP
> for the sake for religious purity.

Aristotle Pagaltzis suggested a
[markable way](http://nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/231641) to
deprecate the code. Worth the read.

### Yet another Smart Match proposal?

Continuing the
[Smart Match discussion](http://nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/231597),
and with impending flame risk, Dave Mitchell had bravely
[suggested](http://nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/231622)
yet another Smart Match syntax.

It seems Dave is focusing on making `given/when` more readable and at the
same time, faster, and easier to implement.

Paul "LeoNerd" Evans suggested using new syntax keywords, such as:

    use feature 'dispatch';

    dispatch($str) {
        on("hello") { say "Hello, there"; }
        on("bye")   { say "Goodbye then"; }
    }

Eirik Berg Hanssen suggests providing keywords for the comparison itself -
whether `scase` and `ncase` for string vs. numerical comparison respectively, or `wheneq` and `when==` (suggested by Paul).

### z/OS perl port

Karl Williamson is continuing his work on porting perl to z/OS. Only one
test is failing now.

To help understand the failing test and how dynamic linking works in
z/OS, Jarkko Hietaniemi, Bulk88, John Goodyear, Yaroslav Kuzmin,
Ray Mullins, and Sandra jumped in to investiate and understand how z/OS
works in this regard.

This might result in simply a sanity check (as Aristotle Pagaltzis
described it) which does not apply in z/OS.

The thread continues
[here](http://nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/231660).

### Coro branch that works on 5.22

Reini Urban created a [Coro fork](https://github.com/rurban/Coro/tree/5.22)
which contains patches to work on perl 5.22.

### What should `qr/\p{pkg::L}/` do?

Karl Williamson
[asks](http://nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/231658) what
should the regexp `qr/\p{pkg::L}/` do. While currently evaluating to the
Unicode property **letter**, Karl offers it fails on compile- or run-time
as the property `pkg::L` is not found.

Agreed by Ricardo Signes with a suggestion to improve the error from "not
found" to something more descriptive (such as "illegal name").

### Warn or die on `/(?-p)/`?

Yves Orton had suggested to close
[Perl #126185](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126185)
as *WONTFIX* since he deems warning good enough. Seconded by Karl
Williamson (but to close as *Rejected*).

Yves also noted
[additional comments](http://nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/231667)
worth a read to anyone interested in regular expressions in finer detail.

### Ignore errors configurably

Linda Walsh requests comments in
[Perl #126314](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126314) on a
proposal for being able to configure in files to ignore new exceptions in
order to handle applications which die when using fatal warnings and
encountering new warnings in new versions of perl.
