# October 12th-19th

## Updates

Dave Mitchell merged the regular expression substring match optimization
branch!

James Keenan cleaned more tickets, namely
[Perl #117963](https://rt.perl.org/rt3/Ticket/Display.html?id=117963),
[Perl #120330](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=120330), and
[Perl #65052](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=65052).

James also updates on
[Perl #123831](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123831) that
he is able to successfully compile perl on an older Darwin system. The
ticket refers to problems in some definitions the ICC compiler has which
caused problems compiling perl.

Yves Orton is working on resolving what seems to be an inifinte recursion
error in the regex engine, raised by
[Perl #126182](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126182).

Steve Hay was looking at why
[bignum](https://metacpan.org/pod/bignum),
[Math::BigInt](https://metacpan.org/pod/Math::BigInt), and
[Math::BigInt::FastCalc](https://metacpan.org/pod/Math::BigInt::FastCalc)
are outdated in core. With input from their current maintainer, Peter
John Acklam, Steve is going to update them to the latest versions
available on CPAN.

Reini Urban has been banned from the p5p mailing list following
uncivilized behavior displayed on the list. Ricard Signes asked that
Reini focuse on technical discussions and apologize for the comments
made, or resign from the list. Following a refusal to comply, Reini
was banned.

Max Maischein provided his work on resolving
[Perl #125439](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=125439) for
comments.

Bulk88 submitted a patch in
[Perl #126377](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126377) to
remove an extra `stat` call.

Similar to this, Bulk88 also provided a patch in
[Perl #126373](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126373)
to reimplement the `$^WIN32_SLOPPY_STAT` as a magic variable. The ticket
contains details of the differences before and after in a syscall log.

Lastly, Bulk88 also provided a patch in
[Perl #126402](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126402) to
allow two perl processes to share more memory using const vtables.

Dagfinn Ilmari MannsÃ¥ker submitted a patch in
[Perl #126374](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126374) to
fix [IO::Poll](https://metacpan.org/pod/IO::Poll)'s handling of empty
poll arrays.

Tony Cook
[provides](http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2015/10/msg231948.html)
his 24th Perl 5 Grant Report.

Jarkko reported in
[Perl #126396](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126396) and then
fixed a long double problem in IRIX.

Brian Carpenter reminds the list of null pointer dereferencing bugs,
[Perl #125351](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=125351),
[Perl #125540](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=125540),
[Perl #126191](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126191), and
[Perl #126192](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126192).

Filipe asks in
[Perl #126403](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126403) if
a buffered `read()` call can be smarted about the chunk size it uses. He
provides examples of having more system calls than needed in situations
like:

    read( $fh, $buffer, 30000 )

since `read()` always uses 8,192 byte chunks nowadays.

## Bugs

### Reported bugs

[Perl #126368](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126368) refers
to a breakage in
[Filesys::DfPortable](https://metacpan.org/pod/Filesys::DfPortable).

[Perl #126366](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126366), in
which we're asked whether Perl works on Windows 10. Response: Yes.

[Perl #126376](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126376) which
displays a problem of `goto` interfering with a `$SIG{__DIE__}` handler
which should be displayed with a `__DIE__` handler.

[Perl #126328](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126328) refers to
a possible inconsistent behavior in the regexp engine behavior with
different backtracking control verbs.

[Perl #126343](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126343) describes
a similar scenario in the regex engine.

[Perl #126327](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126327) exposes
a problem when, in a specific situation, an optimization in the regular
expression engine does not trigger the `*SKIP` control verb. Yves Orton
provides additional information on the original considerations and possible
ways to resolve this (such as keeping the optimization but allowing a user
to add a flag to disable it if they need to).

## Discussion

Jarkko Hietaniemi
[shares](http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2015/10/msg231811.html)
some insight on problems with MacPorts lagging behind new XCode updates.

Sawyer X (yes, me) asked on the behavior of XS subroutines (XSUBs)
signature checks. When the signature is not `SV *` and is a native C type
(such as `int`), and you send `undef`, it will caused an uninitialized
warning. Vincent Pit explained this as intended behavior and why. However,
when you send `undef` to a signature which has a different Perl type which
is not `SV *` (such as `CV *`), it still warns before croaking. Sawyer
will attempt to provide a patch to fix this.

A very nice thank you email from Emmanuel Arias:

Bulk88
[adds](http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2015/10/msg231885.html)
more comments on the discussion with Dave Mitchell regarding debugging
the Save Stack, mentioned last week.

More from Jarkko's learnings, a
[warning](http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2015/10/msg231883.html)
provided on OpenBSD regarding `strcat`. Detailed comment by Zefram with
more context around `strcat` and then OpenBSD thoughts behind the warning
and some information from Craig A. Berry relating to Perl specifically.

Steve Hay raised problems compiling
[Socket](https://metacpan.org/pod/Socket) on VC6 and pushed a fix by
Bulk88 to blead.

Steve is also
[reporting](http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2015/10/msg231903.html)
several failing tests on GCC Builds. Bulk88 is helping diagnose the
causes.

On Mac OS X Perl has relied on setting `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` to 10.3.
On El Capitan this now fails. The problem generated a long
[discussion](http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2015/10/msg231808.html)
including a
[StackOverflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32280732/whats-the-best-way-to-set-macosx-deployment-target/32284231#32284231)
and a conversation on a related
[ticket](https://trac.macports.org/ticket/49273) in MacPorts, not to
mention tickets
[Perl #123985](https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=123985) and
[Perl #126360](https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=126360).

The end result was to use `-mmacosx-version-min` option, which
resolves correctly on MAC OS X 10.6 and above. I think Craig A. Berry
[summarized](http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2015/10/msg231870.html)
it well.
