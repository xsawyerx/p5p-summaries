# October 20th-25th

## Updates

Additional
[grant reports](http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/232023)
from Dave Mitchell. The majority of the work was spent on overhauling
the context stack. End result? Fixes for the original issue ("death
during unwinding causes crash") and entering and existing subroutines and
loop will be a *lot* faster!

Additional
[grant report](http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/232070)
by Tony Cook. Tony has spent around 16 hours, reviews or worked on
approximately 12 tickets and applied 2 patches.

Ricardo Signes updates that November will have an Onion Sketch. The Onion
Sketch was mentioned in the
[last update](http://blogs.perl.org/users/sawyer_x/2015/10/perl-5-porters-mailing-list-summary-october-12th-19th.html).

Ricardo also applied a patch by Peter Rabbitson (Ribasushi) in order to
get [Carp](https://metacpan.org/pod/Carp) passing on older toolchains.
Ricardo asked for additional eyes on the commit before a release - Craig
A. Berry gives an A-OK on it.

Bulk88 provided a now-merged patch in
[Perl #126412](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126412) to
address the GCC builds failing on Windows, mentioned on
[this](http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/231903)
discussion thread.

Tony Cook
[adds](http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/msg232064)
more information on the `__DIE__` + `goto` leading to infinite recursion
and segfault.

Tony also cleaned up tickets:
* [Perl #125891](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=125981) was a
ticket about a behavior with tied filehandles and I/O which is deemed not
a bug.
* [Perl #126062](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126062),
which raises a possible issue with
[Digest::SHA](https://metacpan.org/pod/Digest::SHA), but is not maintained
by p5p and the discussion seems to have dropped.

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason had issues reintroducing the new warnings pragma
category due to technical reasons, and - as he put it:

> [...] about to spawn a subprocess.

All the best and have a merry PID. :)

The [Thread::Queue](https://metacpan.org/pod/Thread::Queue) in core is
updated to version 3.07.

Dennis Kaarsemaker provides some improvements for the simple
`.travis.yml` file mentioned in
[Perl #123981](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123981).

Karl Williamson updates that perl now passes all tests on z/OS. Karl
gave a great
[summary](http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/232118)
of his work.


## Bugs

### Reported bugs

[Perl #126414](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126414),
opened by Bulk88, discussed perl storing inodes in NVs/doubles, and
mentions possible rounding for inode integers, possibly causing a
mismatch when comparing them.

[Perl #126410](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126410),
reported by Todd Rinaldo, tries to raise (and address, with a provided
patch) a situation in which perl creates a destructor cache when there
isn't an `AUTOLOAD` or `DESTROY` method. The patch prevents that from
happening.

[Perl #126407](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126407),
reported by Vadim Pushtaev, asks about `AUTOLOAD` being called for
the `DESTROY` method. This seems related to the ticket above, opened by
Todd Rinaldo. Vadim also found this already exists as
[Perl #124387](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=124387).

[Perl #126437](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126437),
reported by Ed Avis, asks about `hex`'s behavior with invalid input in
relation to its documentation. Eirik Berg Hanssen adds this useful hex
check pattern:

    eval { use warnings "FATAL"; hex(s/^\s+|\s+$//rg) }

[Perl #126432](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126432),
reported by Peter J. Holzer, suggests inconsistencies with
autovivification. Dave Mitchell commented on the ticket, explaining how
perl understands the code used in the ticket.

### Resolved bugs

* [Perl #126309](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126309):
  `x` operator on list causes segfaults, confuses valgrind.
* [Perl #117341](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=117341):
  `av_undef`'s POD is confusing.
* [Perl #126181](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126181):
  `\c` inside `(?[])` causes panics and unexpected behavior.
* [Perl #126178](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126178):
  `/(?i/` and similar should raise an error.
* [Perl #126253](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126253):
  `/.{1}??/` should be an error.


## Discussion

Due to the new parallel Win32 `dmake` feature, a race condition failure
was discovered. [POSIX](https://metacpan.org/pod/POSIX)'s `Makefile.PL`
file was throwing an error (swallowed by `make_ext.pl`), and a POSIX XS
binary was created with missing subs. Tests were failing despite the POSIX
binary loading.

The error in the `Makefile.PL` was traced to POSIX being built before
[version](https://metacpan.org/pod/version) was, and
[ExtUtils::MakeMaker](https://metacpan.org/pod/ExtUtils::MakeMaker)'s
Pure Perl fallback required core XS modules aren't available in
`miniperl`.

A number of fixes were proposed by Bulk88 and Steve Hay, the simplest of
which was eventually committed.

The entire discussions can be read on the
[thread](http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/232039).

Jarkko Hietaniemi has been running [Coverity](https://www.coverity.com/)
and found a few issues with [POSIX](https://metacpan.org/pod/POSIX).
Jarkko has been asking about specific file descriptor usage. Tony Cook
mentions the known implications in how they're used and Jarkko suggests
possibly cleaning it anyway.

Michael Felt reports a smoker not working on an AIX machine due to IPv6
tests.

Karl Williamson
[explains](http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/232151)
problems with the implemented `\s{wb}` and `\s{sb}` in perl 5.22, and
suggests to include fixes in 5.22.1 despite perl versions policies.
So far he received positive feedback on this suggestion.
