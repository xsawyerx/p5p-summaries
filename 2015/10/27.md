Thanks to Steve Hay for the work!

More agreement with Karl Williamson's suggestion to include fixes to
`\s{wb}` and `\s{sb}` in perl 5.22.1, but due to performance hit concerns
raised by Yves Orton, it was left out of 5.22.1.

Bulk88 offered an updated patch for Win32 parallel builds in
[Perl #126452](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126452), which
was merged.

Jarkko Hietaniemi resolved a few older IRIX compilation tickets (mentioned
below).

Tony Cook provided a solution for some Coverity issues (mentioned last
week) Jarkko has been working through.

Dave Mitchell has another
[grant report](http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/232244)
for us. Dave continued working on the context stack, but also took a break
to see about optimizing some arithmetic operations, making the *nbody*
benchmarks (focusing heavily on floating point vector arithmetic) about
a third faster. Great news! Bulk88 provided several improvement points
to the code which Dave had created another branch for.

## Bugs

### Reported bugs

[Perl #126480](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126480),
reported by Dan Collins, shows an assertion failure with the code:

    pipe$$5,0

[Perl #126482](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126482),
reported by Dan, shows another assertion failure with the code:

    sub(){sub ub(){0}ub ub

[Perl #126481](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126481),
reported by Dan, is one more assertion failure with the code:

    0=/(?[!!(\w])/

Which had been fixed the next day by Karl Williamson.

[Perl #126469](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126469),
reported by Ben Bullock, asks to document the second argument of
`sv_reftype`. Patches by Tony Cook added.

[Perl #126474](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126474),
reported by Kazuho Oku, mentions that unsafe signal handlers use
`newSVsv`, thus calling `malloc`. He opened the bug since perl 5.17
introduces this call at all times, which wasn't the case prior.

[Perl #126484](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126484),
reported by Andreas J. Koening, mentions that perl 5.23.3 breaks
[Lexical::SealRequireHints](https://metacpan.org/pod/Lexical/SealRequireHints).

[Perl #126472](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126472),
also reported by Andreas, shows a problem in 5.23.3 breaking additional
modules which run very explicit checks for a behavior which does not break
the module, but the specific test. Dave Mitchell advised updating the
test.

[Perl #126502](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126502),
reported by masterchiefaragorn, shows that once you `freeze` and `thaw`
floating point numbers using [Storable](https://metacpan.org/pod/Storable)
they will no longer be equal using `==`. Zefram explains in the ticket
why this happens.

### Resolved bugs

* [Perl #125298](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=125298):
  `warnings.t` one failure in IRIX 6.5.

  Don't distribute `version::vpp/EUMM::version::vpp`.
* [Perl #116062](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=116062):
  Installing perl 5.16.2 in SGI IRIX 6.2.
* [Perl #39797](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=39797):
  Unable to build Perl under IRIX with `-Duseshrplib`.
* [Perl #125314](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=125314):
  Configuring with Accflags `DAPPLLIB_EXP` broke in 5.22.0.
* [Perl #126468](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126468):
  (Duplicate of [Perl #125314].)
* [Perl #126309](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126309):
  `x` operator on list causes segfault, confuses valgrind (64-bit).
* [Perl #126481](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126481):
  Assert fail with `0=/(?[!!(\w])/`

## Discussion

More conversation happening in
[Perl #126414](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126414)
about number rounding in perl (mentioned last week). Tony Cook suggests
using `EOVERFLOW` (as both Solaris and FreeBSD do) and to warn if the
value of inodes changes because of rounding. Aristotle Pagaltzis supports
stringifying and Bulk88 notes it might be the only way to handle 128 bit
inodes.

Ricardo Signes
[suggests](http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/232223)
opening a meta ticket in order to track all the
fuzzer-related bugs. Dan Collins wants a way to triage the tickets and
have multiple users be able to edit them, even if only a spreadsheet.

Paul "LeoNerd" Evans
[wonders](http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/232245)
if it's possible to warn about POD in the
middle of an expression. Unfortunately, as shown by Eric Brine and
H.Merijn "Tux" Brand, it's a problematic idea, partly because of functions
and partly because of indirect notation support.

The discussion on optimizing read (mentioned last week) in
[Perl #126403](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126403)
is continuing. Craig A. Berry wonders whether the suggested solutions
really speed things up. Apparently on GNU/Linux and Macs (or more
accurately, non-Windows) it does. Craig will try to provide a clean
patch, but no promises on when.
