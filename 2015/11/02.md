# November 2nd-9th

## Updates

Ricardo Signes is updating that the
[**#onionsketch**](http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/184115)
is back! Wednesday, November 18th is the next sketch meeting, at 14:00 NYC
time.

Craig A. Berry shared his latest patch on
[Perl #126403](https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=126403),
that addresses speeding up `read` on Windows, which seems very promising.

A grant
[report](http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/232353)
by Tony Cook, the summary of which is:

> Approximately 16 tickets were reviewed or worked on, and 6 patches
> were applied.

Tony's september grant
[report](http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/232354) is
also available. Tony worked or or reviewed approximately 42 tickets.

H.Merijn (Tux) Brand updates that
[Getopt::Long](https://metacpan.org/pod/Getopt::Long) is now available
on [Github](https://github.com/sciurius/perl-Getopt-Long).

Tony Cook opened a meta ticket,
[Perl #126546](https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=126546),
to keep track of any issues detected by fuzzing.

Jarkko Hietaniemi provides
[an update](http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/232395)
on his Coverity work.

Tony Cook is trying to resolve (unrelated tickets)
[Perl #126042](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126042)
(fuzzer-found segfault)
and
[Perl #57512](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=57512)
(implicit `close` silently unchecked for error),
providing patches for both.

Bulk88 is
[continuing](http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/232352)
his quest to remove bootstrap files and proposed
[two patches](http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/232416)
to handle this.

Bulk88 also provided two patches (that were already applied by
Tony Cook) to re-parallelize Win32 builds (after
[Unicode::Normalize](https://metacpan.org/pod/Unicode::Normalize) was
reimplemented in XS, and to remove useless build product file
`/win32/config.w32`.

A problem raised and solved in
[Perl #126582](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126582)
by Jarkko Hietaniemi on accidental bit-shifting, following a
discussion (mentioned under **Discussion** below).

Bulk88
[updates](http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/232464)
everyone that perl was forked by Michael Schwern under the name
[piledriver](https://github.com/evalEmpire/piledriver/blob/master/README.md).

## Bugs

### Reported bugs

[Perl #126162](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126162),
reported by Andreas J. Koening (in turn from a report by Slaven
Rezić). A commit in perl which changes how `stat` behaves when
receiving an array breaks
[perl5i](https://metacpan.org/pod/perl5i).

[Perl #126544](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126544),
reported by Jim Avera, asks to document variables used in the
synopsis of the `fcntl` function.

[Perl #126556](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126556),
reported by Atoomic, raises the question on destruction when using
an `INIT` block. More on that under **Discussion** below.

[Perl #126552](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126552),
reported by Shlomi Fish, raises a possible bug in the Perl Debugger,
which turns out to be a case of confusing closures.

[Perl #126579](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126579),
reported by Ricardo Signes, notes that after resolving
[Perl #121085](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=121085)
(warning on filenames with newlines), there is still a warning
even after a newline is stripped by a two-arg `open` call.

[Perl #126586](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126586),
reported by Jarkko Hietaniemi, relates to
[Perl #126582](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126582)
and the parsing of hexadecimal floats.

[Perl #126593](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126593),
reported by Andreas J. Koening (discovered by Slaven Rezić),
Bleadperl breaks
[App::test::travis](https://metacpan.org/pod/App::test::travis).

## Discussion

Michael Felt (from [AIXTools](http://www.aixtools.net/)) sent an
[email](http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/232408)
to p5p asking for help digging into a segmentation fault he's
exploring.

Yaroslav Kuzmin
[emailed](http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/232383)
about a hanging test in z/OS. Karl Williamson is already on it,
providing branches to test out a fix.

Zsbán Ambrus
[asks](http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/232426)
about comparisons of integers and floating point numbers. Zefram
responded that a comparison of mixed types was never planned to
behave well and would be more complex and expensive. Ambrus
disagrees but notes that difficult to implement correct and to
test properly.

In
[Perl #126556](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126556)
question on expected behavior (and the documentation of such)
with regard to destruction when using an `INIT` block. It does not
seem to be a bug but could possibly a problematic limitation. Todd
Rinaldo tries to carefully describe it as:

> So to rephrase what we're saying here: We're saying that any
> variable used in an INIT block like this either needs to be
> weakened or will never be destroyed until global destruction?
> I'm inclined to say that's a problem. At the least it should be
> documented right?

Philip Prindeville
[asks](http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/232441)
about a possible feature for
[IO::Pipe](https://metacpan.org/pod/IO::Pipe) allowing you to
have access to the child PID. Chas Owens suggested using `open`
instead.

A
[discussion](https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=122219)
started on support of hexadecimal floats yielded the following
interesting observation, described by Jarkko:

> So it really does look like the hexfp parsing code
> implementation is leaking over to supporting unintentionally
> also binary and octal...

Additionally, I will begin quoting the following emergent
description of Perl, a result of a conversation on the ticket
between Eirik Berg Hanssen and Jarkko:

Eirik:

> ... that's just emergent behaviour?
> Cool! :)

Jarkko:

> "Emergent behaviour" describes the whole of Perl rather beautifully,
> don't you think?

Bulk88 suggests that the distributions (such as
[Carp](https://metacpan.org/pod/Carp)) be separated into their own
repository with their own history instead of sharing the perl core
repository.

In the discussion around unsafe signal handlers in
[Perl #126474](https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=126474)
Leon Timmermans suggests checking out his
[Signal::Pipe](https://github.com/Leont/signal-pipe) module and Tony
Cook has additional comments on possible improvements in the noted
case.

Continued discussion in
[Perl #126437](https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=126437)
about the documentation of `hex` and now its behavior as well.
