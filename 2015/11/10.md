Aaron Crane has updated
[Perl #119437](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=119437)
on the status of the implicit dereference in `push` to a reference
as an unsuccessful experiment.

[ExtUtils::MakeMaker](https://metacpan.org/pod/ExtUtils::MakeMaker)
released a new version which reverted many changes, including a
commit by Sisyphus to build when `sh.exe` is in the path (but
**following** `cmd.exe`) and several changes by Bulk88. Therefore,
both Sisyphus and Bulk88 resubmitted their "lost" patches to include
in `EUMM` (`ExtUtils::MakeMaker`).

Tony Cook
[provides](http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/232524)
another grant report. About 16 hours spent, 13 tickets reviewed or
worked on, and 5 patches applied.

Dave Mitchell had merged his fast arithmetic branch. Expect
even faster basic arithmetic in the next perl version! You can read
more about it in his grant report mentioned below.

Dave
[provides](http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/232534)
a grant report. 98:49 total hours. He worked mainly on the
aforementioned arithmetic optimizations and the overhaul of the
perl context stack and dynamic scope implementation.

Dave also mentioned he
[applied](http://news.perlfoundation.org/2015/11/grant-extension-request-1.html)
for an extension of his Perl core grant. The Perl Foundation is
looking for comments. If you want to show appreciation (other than
a thank-you email to p5p and/or Dave), you can provide comments
on the grant extension request.

Ricardo Signes is making a few CPAN releases
([PathTools](https://metacpan.org/pod/PathTools)
and [base](https://metacpan.org/pod/base)) in order to fix
the installation path on perl 5.12 and above.

Ricardo
[wants](http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/232608)
to remove [encoding.pm](https://metacpan.org/pod/encoding). He
asks about any blockers.

Ed Avis noticed the docs sometimes use *lookahead* and sometimes
*look-ahead* (with or without a hyphen) and provided a patch to
solve it in
[Perl #126608](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126608).
Tony Cook provided additional comments.

[Module::Metadata](https://metacpan.org/pod/Module::Metadata)
is passing several **TODO** tests, adding more output to the
build process. Karen Etheridge updates it will be resolved soon.

Mohammed El-Afifi provided a patch in
[Perl #126611](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126611)
for [File::Find](https://metacpan.org/pod/File::Find) to prevent
death in case an empty array is provided.

Dagfinn Ilmari Mannsåker provided a patch in
[Perl #126609](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126609)
to include the error message when
[IPC::Open3](https://metacpan.org/pod/IPC::Open3) fails. It was
applied by Tony Cook.

Bulk88 submitted patches in
[Perl #126632](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126632)
(which he intends to revise further) to add parallelness to
Win32/GNUmakefile.

## Bugs

### Reported bugs

[Perl #126602](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126602),
reported by Brian Carpenter, is a fuzzer-found double-free
segfault caused by the code:

    s//*_=0;s|0||;00.y0/e

Tony Cook debugged and provided submitted a patch for review.

[Perl #126613](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126613),
reported by Dan Collins, also found by a fuzzer, causes a segfault
with the code:

    /(?{s0})|(?{s0:})/|s|||eg|y|||

[Perl #126614](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126614),
reported by Dan as well by fuzzing, segfaults with:

    /(?{})|(??{U:0})/|s|||g

[Perl #126615](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126615),
another fuzzer-discovered fuzzer by Dan with the code:

    00./(?[[0]+()+])/

This was already fixed by Karl Williamson.

Andreas J. Koenig opened several tickets for bleadperl breaking
the following modules:

* [Perl #126621](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126621)

## Discussion

The ticket
[Perl #126602](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126602)
sparked a response from Zefram on a slew of problems with stack
refcounting. He
[proposes](http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/232508)
a way to handle them which will require some major overhauls. Dave
Mitchell
[proposes](http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/232510)
another way which wouldn't require the same amount of work and
might prevent breakage in API.

A breakage caused by a
[commit](http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/232612)
which required a version number bump raised a
[rant](http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/232613)
by Jarkko Hietaniemi on tests which require such version bumps
which conflict with how one might run tests. The thread continues
[here](http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/232630).

Jarkko also
[mentioned](http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/232553)
a Python change suggestion to provide a faster directory iterator.
This also evolved into a conversation on the `stat` caching feature.

Steve Hay
[suggests](http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/232615)
maintenance releases should also include back-ported fixes to
features introduced in those stable releases. Aaron Crane provided
a patch to address this in the policy.

Peter John Acklam
[wondered](http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/232594)
about results when working with infinite numbers and exponents.
Additional details provided by Sisyphus and Glenn Golden, it would
appear that the computing part of these operations were marked as
*contentious* by IEEE during the early 754-2008 process.
