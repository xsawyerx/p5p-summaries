# November 23rd-29th

## Updates

Peter Rabbitson (ribasushi) has volunteered to maintain
[base.pm](https://metacpan.org/pod/base) to continue support for
perl 5.6.

Christian Jaeger
[announced](http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/232795)
the alpha release of [Functional Perl](http://functional-perl.org/).

Another
[grant report](http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/323905)
from Tony Cook. In about 19 hours of work, Tony reviewed or worked on
17 tickets and applied 3 patches. More details available in the grant
report. Tony provided a
[full report](http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/323906)
for October as well, covering over 51 hours of work.

Per a request by Dennis Kaarsemaker, Dave Mitchell has worked on
reducing the chatter of a smoke test.

Karen Etheridge submitted a now-merged patch to reduce additional
noise from a
[Module::MetaData](https://metacpan.org/pod/Module::MetaData)
test when run under core testing environment.

## Bugs

### Reported bugs

[Perl #126710](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126710),
reported by Tony Cook, mentions that pure-Perl modules that have
no `Makefile.PL` (which then use `make_ext.pl`), cause a rebuild
because `make_ext.pl` doesn't actually check for fresh files
before touching `pm_to_blib` - which causes a rebuild.

[Perl #126709](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126709),
reported by Lukas Mai, demonstrates that `local *PACKAGE::` can
lead to segfaults and bizarre errors. Dave Mitchell was able to
reduce this further and explain why it happens.

[Perl #126706](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126706),
reported by Dominyk Tiller, is a compilation error on OS X El
Capitan with the new security feature `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH`.

[Perl #126719](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126719),
reported by Michael Adamcik, raises a problem with
[Encode](https://metacpan.org/pod/Encode) consuming all memory.
Tony Cook investigated and opened a ticket against
[Encode](https://metacpan.org/pod/Encode),
[RT #10955](https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=109555).

[Perl #126735](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126735),
reported by KES, indicates a perl debugging disconnect problem.

### Resolved bugs

* [Perl #126257](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126257):
  Invalid `ARRAY` attribute leads to `Perl_op_lvalue_flags` assertion
  fail.
* [IO::Select](https://metacpan.org/pod/IO::Select) does not remove
  closed file. (Bug already fixed in 2011.)
* [Perl #126687](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126687):
  Duplicate of
  [Perl #126686](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126686).
* [Perl #126635](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126635):
  Bleadperl breaks
  [Data::Integer](https://metacpan.org/pod/Data::Integer).
* [Perl #126480](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126480):
  `Perl_pp_pipe_op` assertion fail when first arg to pipe is
  definitely not a filehandle.
* [Perl #126443](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126443):
  Use-After-free in Parser.
* [Perl #123710](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123710):
  Segmentation fault in `Perl_sv_setpvn`.
* [Perl #115116](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=115116):
  Limit code points to `IV_MAX`.

## Proposed patches

Tony Cook worked on several bugs, providing patches:

* Helping with the error handling of
  [Perl #123737](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123737).
* Fixing another Bleadperl module breaking (this time of
  [App::test::travis](https://metacpan.org/pod/App::test::travis))
  in
  [Perl #126593](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126593).
* Fixing a memory corruption bug:
  [Perl #124097](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=124097).
* Null pointer dereferencing in
  [Perl #123991](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123991).

Sergey Leschenko provides a patch in
[Perl #126707](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126707),
for fixing a race condition in a test, possibly due to the
VirtualBox environment.

Shlomi Fish provided a patch for the aforementioned
[Perl #126735](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126735).

## Discussion

Ed Avis opened
[Perl #126715](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126715)
to discuss seek comments on whether barewords-as-strings are still
used in code, in order to understand whether they could be
deprecated and removed from core. So far there seems to be little
knowledge of many such patterns (few examples given), and the
conversation split to the definition of "barewords" itself.

Additional
[comments](http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/232805)
provided by Dave Mitchell for Christian Hansen's proposed patches for
faster UTF-X validation and conversation ensued on the meaning of
`U32_ALIGNMENT_REQUIRED`.

Conversation on how to handle incorrect parameters in
[File::Glob](https://metacpan.org/pod/File::Glob) continues in
[Perl #126239](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126239).

Dave Mitchell
[asks](http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/323888)
whether `PROTOTYPES` are actually enabled by default.

Another
[question](http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/323885)
from Dave on whether the `PerlIOMmap_close` function, defined in
`ext/PerlIO-mmap/mmap.xs`, can be deleted as unused or not. Craig
A. Berry provides some context, mentioning he thinks it can be
deleted.

Glenn Golden
[asks](http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/232956)
whether he should open a bug or not on some odd inconsistency he
sees in `%a` formatting option between perl's and C's `printf`
function.
