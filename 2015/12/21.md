## News and updates

Perl 5.23.6 is now available, thanks to David Golden! You can read
his awesome announcement
[here](http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/233475).
Here's the sneak peak of it:

> A long, long time ago in microseconds, in a galaxy not very far
> away...

I don't want to ruin the rest, go check out it!

Interested in helping out in Perl? Why not make a release?
Ricardo Signes is
[looking](http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/233505)
for more release managers.

Karl Williamson officially deprecated `to_utf8_case`.

Chad Granum submitted a patch in
[Perl #127000](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=127000)
to update to latest
[Test-Simple](https://metacpan.org/release/Test-Simple) release.

## Bugs

### Reported bugs

* [Perl #126981](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126981):
  Possible regression using constant for hash key in perl 5.22+.
* [Perl #126991](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126991):
  Integer overflow in line number tracking reported by `caller()`.
* [Perl #127026](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=127026):
  [B::Deparse](https://metacpan.org/pod/B::Deparse) fails to
  correctly deparse hash-derefs with conditional logic within.
* [Perl #127028](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=127028):
  `perlfunc -f given` gives POD syntax error.

### Resolved bugs

* [Perl #126261](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126261):
  Unknown regexp modifier/unmatched `[` raises assertion.
* [Perl #126960](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126960):
  [Math::BigFloat](https://metacpan.org/pod/Math::BigFloat) giving
  NaN on multiplying 1 * 1e-05.

## Proposed patches

Bulk88 updated his patches in
[Perl #126632](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126632).
As always, he detailed additional interesting information about the
given problem and how to solve it.

Dagfinn Ilmari Manns√•ker had *accidentally a patch* for
[Perl #126981](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126981)
(described above) way too quickly to be considered done by a human.
Still, it's already being smoked by James E. Keenan.

## Discussion

In a
[discussion](http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/233391)
on adding features to [Exporter](https://metacpan.org/pod/Exporter),
Ricardo Signes
[summarized](http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/233477)
the different considerations and his position on them. It seems like
[Exporter](https://metacpan.org/pod/Exporter) might get the ability
to import subroutines under a different name.

The conversation on UTF-8 in identifiers
[continues](http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/233497).

Yves Orton raises an issue (discovered by fuzzing
[Sereal](https://metacpan.org/pod/Sereal)) in which Perl might segfault
if given broken utf8 (marked as utf8) to globnames and package names.
He
[asks](http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/233486)
if people think it warrants a ticket or just a doc patch. Bulk88
[adds](http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/233490)
his two cents on how paranoid one can get. A fun read.
