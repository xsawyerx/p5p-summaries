> A year here and he still dreamed of cyberspace, hope fading
> nightly. All the speed he took, all the turns he'd taken and
> the corners he cut in Night City, and he'd still see the matrix
> in his dreams, bright lattices of logic unfolding across that
> colourless void...The Sprawl was a long, strange way home now
> over the Pacific, and he was no Console Man, no cyberspace
> cowboy. Just another hustler, trying to make it through. But
> the dreams came on in the Japanese night like livewire voodoo,
> and he'd cry for it, cry in his sleep, and wake alone in the
> dark, curled in his capsule in some coffin hotel, hands clawed
> into the bedslab, temper foam bunched between his fingers,
> trying to reach the console that wasn't there.

[Encode](https://metacpan.org/pod/Encode) 2.79 is released!

[podlators](https://metacpan.org/release/podlators) 4.05 is
released!

Tony Cook provides his
[10th](http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/233802)
and [11th](http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/233814)
reports for his 6th grant. A total of 38 hours of work, with 27
tickets reviewed or worked on, and 4 patches applied.

Dave Mitchell provides his grant
[reports](http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/233806).
He worked a total of 5.5 hours these past two weeks, mainly on
tweaking `Porting/bench.pl` to display results for just a single
executable in a more compact form.

Aaron Crane had reduced the problem in
[Perl #127323](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=127323)
(segfault with [Storable](https://metacpan.org/pod/Storable))
to a problem with [JSON::XS](https://metacpan.org/pod/JSON::XS)
or [Cpanel::JSON::XS](https://metacpan.org/pod/Cpanel::JSON::XS).

Dave Mitchell removed usages of `PRIVSHIFT` from the source code,
more details available
[here](http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/233817).

Karl Williamson
[updates](http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/233765)
the list about proposed update
[UTS #39](http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr39/tr39-12.html),
Unicode Security Mechanism.

Karl Williamson
[notes](http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/233824)
that `qr/\b{lb}/` is now added to bleadperl, providing the final
Unicode boundary type previous missing from core Perl: the
LineBreak.

* [Perl #127061](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=127061)

Dagfinn Ilmari Mannsåker provided a patch for
[Perl #121351](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=121351)
to replace the use of `PL_timebuf` with auto variables.

Bulk88 provided a set of patches in
[Perl #127260](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=127260)
for the new threaded
[mem](http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/233685).
allocator for Win32 perl.

Niko Tyni provided a patch in
[Perl #127288](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=127288)
to set UTF8 flag in
[I18N::Langinfo](https://metacpan.org/pod/I18N::Langinfo).

Salvador Fandiño provided a
[patch](http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/233772)
to fix sorting with custom subroutines returning big numbers.

Matthew Horsfall provided a patch to fix
[Perl #6997](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=6997)
where multiple concatenations in void context do not trigger a
warnings, explaining the reasons for it.

## Discussion

After smoking CPAN, Dave Mitchell
[provides](http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/233774)
a patch for
[Scope::Upper](https://metacpan.org/pod/Scope::Upper) which helps
pass most of the tests. Dave adds that Scope::Upper can probably be
reworked so it does not fail with the new context stack system, but
lacks the tuits to do it himself. Vincent Pit (author of
Scope::Upper) notes that it might work but he does not have the time
to do the work now or in the near future.

Dave asks whether, given Scope::Upper can be fixed to work, anyone
has any objections to merging the new context stack system.

Craig A. Berry provided
[details](http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/233751)
on how to handle releasing XS distributions from `./dist`
directory.

Aaron Crane worked on fixing the ABI incompatibility with
`-DDEBUGGING` vs. without (raised in
[Perl #127212](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=127212)),
but it seems a bit trickier than initially thought.

Chad Granum
[provided](http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/233909)
an update on the conversation regarding the proposal to provide
renaming features in [Exporter](https://metacpan.org/pod/Exporter),
with a link to a
[blog post](http://blogs.perl.org/users/chad_exodist_granum/2016/01/the-problem-with-exporters-meet-importer.html)
regarding [Importer](https://metacpan.org/pod/Importer).

Dagfinn Ilmari Mannsåker
[asks](http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/233803)
about exposing more of the `siginfo_t` fields to the sigaction
callback when setting `SA_SIGINFO`. He provided a smoked branch.

Todd Rinaldo asks in
[Perl #127318](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=127318)
if it makes sense for perl to die if an item in `@INC` is
inaccessible, as
[Perl #113422](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=113422)
addressed. Zefram notes the previous behavior was surprising and
earlier errors should not be ignored.

Andreas Koenig and Steve Hay are
[trying](http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/233770)
to update [CPAN.pm](https://metacpan.org/pod/CPAN) in core.

Karl Williamson forwarded an
[email](http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/233903)
from the perl-mvs list hoping someone might be able to help,
relating to warnings compiling perl 5.22.1 on z/OS.

Karl also
[asks](http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/233904)
about a Unicode algorithm problem and possibly a `re` program to
switch between two different meanings for `qr/\b{sb}/`.
